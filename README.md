Welcome to The Monkees.

My project is a website that has been based on a band called 'The Monkees' with years experince. 
I have created a 4 page website included with assets such as images and videos and links to social Media. My primary target
is the fans who want the oppurtunity to use the site to view photos and videos from the band and 
also the avaliablity for events such as wedding and christmas parties. 


Planning of my website:

When I decided to plan my website, I looked at artists that I thought would help me and give me an idea of a layout of what should be included in my page,
for design,colour scheme, font sizes and the flow of my page. When I understood what needed to be the base of my website such as a homepage,gallery page,music page
and contact page. I decided that I would draw my wire frames with a pen and paper for each of my webpages. I made a folder with my assets which were photos.

I researched at diffrent type of websites to look at diffrent colour schemes I could use as well as diffrent fonts and there sizes.Most band pages 
are well laid out and simple but easy to use and find your way around so I wanted mine to be user friendly. The most suitable font I thought was Roboto and sans serif
as they are an easy font on the eye to read.



My Choice of technoloiges:

My first page I created was my home page as that is the page that every user would first get access too.
I added my  navbar that listed out my pages avaliable on my website as displayed to view from left to right.
On my homepage I listed the title of the band, there experince and a short fan welcome message to with a button leading to my contact page.
I also listed the bands main funtions of what they are doing such as wedding, parties,concerts and fans as this was an aim of this project. I also included a photo from the assets I included was a picture of the band playing at a event
with a message to the fans and an button leading to the music page as an option. My footer is a red colour with copy right details at the bottom of my pages.
 I used jumbotron as I liked the presentation it gives as my font and text stands out more. Also my containers helped layout my icons and my diffrent section this was the same for the rest
 of my pages that I created.
 

The second page I created was the music page. I used the same navbar accross all of my pages as well as the footer.On this page i decided to list out the 
top four selling hits that the band ahs released for the fans to see and then i added four youtube clips to the page that can be played. This page was finshed with my footer.

The third page I created was the gallery page. This is started with a short message. I put the heading title as a red colour font as it stands out and the paragraph below
as a black font. I also included a button that links too the conta page also. Below this Included photos of the band and members for users to see.

My final page  is my fourth page and that was the contact page. I listed out the avaliable venues that could be booked for the band. This is was just a black font. Then I included the social media buttons icons
that are, Facebook,Twitter and Youtube. I also included a sign up page as well as a contact form so users could send messages to the band with a booking or a personal message. This was finished with my footer.
 I chose my icons which are Facebook,Twiiter and Youtube. I got my icons from the www.w3sxhools websites under the how to section. These are Links to the facebook pages of The monkees band.

As I created each page i started with the navbar and footer anf after that I added elements like buttons, links, diffrent secions, photos, music clips to make the page more vibrant. This is also why
I picked strong colours to give my page a boost.


Wire frames I designed: 

Here I have included four wire frames from where I based the developement of my website. 
There is a Homepage wireframe,Music wireframe, Gallery wireframe and a contact wireframe.
They are in the assets folder, inside a images folder under Wireframe photos.



Testing process:

I tested my project everytime I included an item such as a new button, a link to a diffrent page to make sure that it was working correctly. I tested diffrent browser sizes as well as my navbars
on each page. When I added my navbar to gallery at first it didnt work as I never closed it with a closing tag but I recorrected this error, it worked straight away. All the rest of my links worked straight 
away which I was pleased with.
