# Welcome to The Monkees. #


 My project is a website that has been based on a band called 'The Monkees' with years experince. 
I have created a 4 page website included with assets such as images and videos and links to social Media. My primary target

also information on avaliablity for events such as wedding and christmas parties.

# Planning of my website: #

When I decided to plan my website, I looked at artists that I thought would help me and give me an idea of a layout of what should be included in my page,
for design,colour scheme, font sizes and the flow of my page. When I understood what needed to be the base of my website such as a homepage,gallery page,music page
and contact page. I decided that I would draw my wire frames with a pen and paper for each of my webpages. I made a folder with my assets which were photos.

I researched at diffrent type of websites to look at diffrent colour schemes I could use as well as diffrent fonts and there sizes.Most band pages 
are well laid out and simple but easy to use and find your way around so I wanted mine to be user friendly. The most suitable font I thought was Roboto and sans serif
as they are an easy font on the eye to read.


# Features #


### Homepage ###


I have created a navbar on all of my pages to give acccess to my diffrent pages which are a Homepage,Music page,Gallery page and contact page.
I have a title and a wecloming message on my homepage to greet users acessing the page.
Below this I have an image included of the band playing at a event. I thought this was fitted to the page after the welcome message section.
I have a section below the image message to state to users where the band have events.
Also there is a little greeting message follwed by a button to listen to music which brings you to the music page. 
Then I have included is a footer with social media icons, I have included in all four pages which is white font and red background.

There is the name of the four songs featured at the top of the page befor the youtube clips.
The music page is where the user can play four diffrent songs from the bands greatest hits through my page. These are youtube videos.
A footer is also included.

# My Choice of technoloiges #

My first page I created was my home page as that is the page that every user would first get access too.
I added my  navbar that listed out my pages avaliable on my website as displayed to view from left to right.
On my homepage I listed the title of the band, there experince and a short fan welcome message to with a button leading to my contact page.
I also listed the bands main funtions of what they are doing such as wedding, parties,concerts and fans as this was an aim of this project. I also included a photo from the assets I included was a picture of the band playing at a event
with a message to the fans and an button leading to the music page as an option. My footer is a red colour with copy right details at the bottom of my pages and social media links.
 I used jumbotron as I liked the presentation it gives as my font and text stands out more. Also my containers helped layout my icons and my diffrent section this was the same for the rest
 of my pages that I created.
 

The second page I created was the music page. I used the same navbar accross all of my pages as well as the footer.On this page I decided to list out the 
top four selling hits that the band ahs released for the fans to see and then I added four youtube clips to the page that can be played. This page was finshed with my footer included is social media links.

The third page I created was the gallery page. This is started with a short message. I put the heading title as a red colour font as it stands out and the paragraph below
as a black font. I also included a button that links too the contact page also. Below this Included photos of the band and members for users to see.

My final page  is my fourth page and that was the contact page. I listed out the avaliable venues that could be booked for the band. This is was just a black font.
 I also included a sign up page as well as a contact form so users could send messages to the band with a booking or a personal message. This was finished with my footer with social media icons.
 I chose my icons which are Facebook,Twiiter and Youtube. I got my icons from the www.w3sxhools websites under the how to section. These are Links to the facebook,twitter and youtube pages of The monkees band.

As I created each page I started with the navbar and footer and after that I added elements like buttons, links, diffrent secions, photos, music clips to make the page more vibrant. This is also why
I picked strong colours to give my page a boost.

my navbar was from bootstrap it was used as I thought it was simple for users to use to link to diffrent areas of the site I picked red for the colour as it stood out. 
Here is the link:  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#nav 

my footer was from the how to section of the w3schools.com website it was a fixed footer and I used this as I thought it would look best at the bottom of my website pages which I coloued red the same as my navbar.
Here is the link to where I got my footer from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_footer.asp Iadded social media icons to it.

I included social media buttons for my contact page they were from https://socialmediawidgets.wordpress.com/all-the-icons/ 

Also my contact form was from wwww3schools as it was  https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_css_forms.asp this form was put in my contact page
to allow the user to contact the band to ask a question about booking a venue or a personal message they would like to send.

I also included a sign up form which I also got from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp


# Wire frames I designed ### 

Here I have included four wire frames from where I based the developement of my website. 
There is a Homepage wireframe,Music wireframe, Gallery wireframe and a contact wireframe.
They are in the assets folder, inside a images folder under Wireframe photos.

My design process for me was to draw my wireframes and add them to my project.
